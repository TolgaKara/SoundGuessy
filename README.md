# SoundGuessy

I notice where is not a way to listen to soundtracks and guessing the Movie, TV-Show, Music, Video Game or Land (Hymne). There is a option but it is really not ux friendly it by hearing the sound on youtube and guessing the soundtrack.

## ::hammer_and_wrench: Support

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/TolgaKara/soundGuessy/issues/new) for support.

## ::memo: Contributing

**You can freely contribute to the Project.**

For setting up the development environment, please read the Heading :package: Installation

The issues are listed under this [Link](https://github.com/TolgaKara/soundGuessy/issues) or follow the List of :construction: TODO. Also if it's needed I change the Repo to a Project to create a Kanban view.

Master is the latest version and I will create more branches to divide the complexity.

In the first Iteration I created a simple JavaScript DOM Game. The second iteration is to change the environment to React.js . Also I am using Tailwind CSS and the HTML Files are full of classes so I will minimize it, with @apply on the stylesheets.
**You can add new modules by changing the Component or adding new Components.**

I will add JEST as a Testing Framework. After that feel free to add Tests.

As style guideline I use prettier and I think it's enough. Also I prefer a minimal readable code for this project.
